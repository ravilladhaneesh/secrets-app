        <p>Last updated: July 22, 2025</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how SecureThem ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and safeguards your
            information when you use our web-based platform. By using our service, you agree to this policy.</p>

                messages.</li>

        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Authenticate your login using OAuth 2.0 (scope: email, profile).</li>
            <li>Send scheduled emails (scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send</code>).</li>
            <li>Securely manage email delivery based on your app usage and instructions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To deliver time-based email reminders and secret sharing securely.</li>
            <li>To store personal notes and sensitive information.</li>
            <li>To notify receivers/nominees based on conditions defined by the user.</li>
            <li>To authenticate and authorize user sessions securely.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Sharing and Storage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No third-party sharing:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or disclose user data to third parties.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (server-side
                encryption).</li>
            <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Used for login session management only.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Protection</h2>
                <p>We take data security seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
                    protect your personal and sensitive data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These
                    include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Encryption:</strong> We use encryption to protect sensitive information during
                        transmission and storage.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Access Control:</strong> We limit access to personal data to authorized personnel only,
                        based on their role and necessity.
                    </li>

                    <li> <strong>Regular Backups:</strong> We perform regular backups of our databases 
                        and systems to ensure that data remains intact and retrievable in the event of technical issues 
                        or system disruptions.
                    </li>


                    
                </ul>

                    <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of
                        transmission
                        over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use
                        commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute
                        security.</p>

        <h2>6. Notes vs Secrets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> For reminders and important information. Users may optionally assign receivers
                for sharing.</li>
            <li><strong>Secrets:</strong> Sensitive content meant to be securely sent to nominees upon inactivity or
                specified events.</li>
        </ul>

                    href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account Permissions</a> after

        </ul>

        <h2>8. In-Product Privacy Notice</h2>
