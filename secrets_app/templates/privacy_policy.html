                    <h2>User Rights</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may access, correct, or delete your data at any time through the Service account page.
                        </li>
                        <li>You may revoke granted access at your discretion.</li>
                        <li>For full deletion, both your SecureThem account and Gmail app access must be removed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Security Practices</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.</li>
                        <li>Access to production systems is strictly controlled with role-based access.</li>
                        <li>Regular security checks are conducted to protect user data.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User content is retained as long as the account is active.</li>
                        <li>Upon account deletion, all associated data is permanently removed within a short grace
                            period.</li>
                        <li><strong>Important:</strong> Users are encouraged to revoke Google OAuth access manually
                            after deleting their SecureThem account.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Email and Google Integration</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We request minimal access via Google OAuth (only scopes necessary to send scheduled emails).
                        </li>
                        <li>SecureThem does not access your inbox, contact list, or email content beyond sending
                            messages you configure.</li>
                        <li>Users can revoke access from their <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions"
                                target="_blank">Google Account Permissions</a>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Revoking Access to Gmail</h2>
                    <p>If you granted SecureThem access to your Gmail account, we strongly encourage you to <a
                            href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">manually revoke access</a>
                        when you no longer use the service or delete your account. This ensures your Gmail remains fully
                        private.</p>
